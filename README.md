# Covid-19-Emergency-Software-Suite
We made this project in order to reduce the number of calls the covid-19 helpline receives in order to avoid people from waiting for a long time. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. We found an innovative idea which will allow this 80 % of the people to use non-traditional means of reporting their symptoms. We also allow people who need urgent care to be able to send a priority message to the authorities. We categorize the users based on their symptoms.
